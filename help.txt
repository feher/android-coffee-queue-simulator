This is a simulation of an office where engineers work.
Every engineer needs some coffee from time-to-time to keep up the good work.
There is only one coffee machine so, the negineers must stand in a queue.
Engineers are sometimes busy. Busy engineers can jump the queue but they cannot take over other busy guys.

The "seconds" that are input to the simulation are "engineer seconds", not real seconds.
The simulation is done in discrete steps.
1 simulation step _takes_ a pre-defined number of real seconds.
1 simulation step _means_ a calculated number of "engineer seconds".
The simulation is done so that the progress bars in the UI do not take more than 5 seconds.

Number of engineers: The number of engineers in the office.

Probability that engineer becomes busy: Percentage between 1 and 100.

Re-evaluate busy status every N seconds: An engineer can become busy only at every N seconds.

Engineer stays busy for N seconds: An engineer stays busy for the given seconds.

Engineer needs coffee every N seconds: An engineer goes for coffee every given N seconds.

Coffee machine makes the coffee in N seconds: It takes N seconds for the coffe machine to prepare one cup of coffee.
